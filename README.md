# 2D Delivery Driver 

My first game made using C# in Unity. 
It's very basic, but it has taught me general knowledge about Unity tools
and C#.

The coolest part for me is how easy it is to make collision boxes for objects.

No more coding up imaginary boundary boxes and calculating the coordinates of
an incoming object.

Maybe more complex collision boxes will require some programming, but I've yet to it.
