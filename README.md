## My Thoughts

My first game made using C# in Unity. 
It's very basic, but it has taught me general knowledge about Unity tools
and C#.

The coolest part is how easy it is to make collision boxes for objects.

No more coding up imaginary boundary boxes and calculating the coordinates of
incoming objects. This was what I did back when I made Flash games in High school with Actionscript.

Maybe more complex collision boxes will require some programming, but I've yet to encounter it.

## Moments I captured during development

I can use my 'WASD' keys to move an object!
